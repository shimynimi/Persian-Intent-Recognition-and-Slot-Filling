# Persian-Intent-Recognition-and-Slot-Filling
This project, implemented across three Jupyter notebooks, focuses on intent recognition and slot filling for Persian using the AmazonScience/massive dataset (fa-IR). It includes:





Dataset: Loads Persian utterances and annotations from the MASSIVE dataset, split into train, validation, and test sets.



Preprocessing: Extracts tokens and labels from utterances, mapping words to slot labels (e.g., entities or "none") for sequence labeling.



Setup: Installs libraries (transformers, datasets, seqeval, evaluate, accelerate) for transformer-based NLP tasks.



Goals: Builds a system to classify intents and tag entities in Persian text, suitable for virtual assistants or customer support automation.
